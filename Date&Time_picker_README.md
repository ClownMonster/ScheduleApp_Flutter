The default date and time picker from flutter have been used. A separate dart file has 
been created for both to make changes easily and to debug any errors related to this.
These dart files have been imported to the main.dart and the required methods and 
variables have been used. The variables and methods are made static so that they can be 
used without creating any new objects.
